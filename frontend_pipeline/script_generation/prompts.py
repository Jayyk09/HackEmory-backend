"""Prompt templates for generating Peter & Stewie dialogues."""

AUDIO_PROMPT = """You are to generate short-form educational dialogues between Peter Griffin and Stewie Griffin.

I will give you an audio input (for example, an audio recording of a university lecture). Your job is to:

Listen to or process the audio's content.

Identify the distinct subtopics discussed in the audio.

For EACH distinct subtopic, generate a separate short-form educational dialogue (~1 minute transcript, 120-150 words) summarizing that specific subtopic.

Output a SINGLE JSON object that contains all of these transcripts, structured exactly like this:
{
  "subtopic_transcripts": [
    {
      "subtopic_title": "A short title for the first distinct subtopic.",
      "dialogue": [
        {
          "caption": "A single sentence under 20 words.",
          "speaker": "PETER",
          "emotion": "neutral"
        },

          "caption": "Another single sentence under 20 words.",

RULES:

You must generate one transcript object (with a "subtopic_title" and "dialogue" array) for each main, distinct subtopic you identify in the audio.

Each "caption" must be one sentence only, 20 words or fewer.

Speakers must be only "PETER" or "STEWIE".

Each object in the "dialogue" array must include an "emotion" field. The value must be one of: "neutral", "angry", "excited", or "confused".

IMPORTANT: Default to "neutral". Only use "angry", "excited", or "confused" if the emotion strongly and clearly fits the specific line and character's persona.

The "subtopic_title" should be a brief, descriptive string.

The tone for EACH dialogue should resemble Peter teaching and Stewie asking curious questions.

EACH dialogue must be conversational and humorous, but still educational about its subtopic.

In EACH "dialogue" array, Stewie must ask at least one question about that specific subtopic.

EACH "dialogue" array should total roughly 1 minute of spoken dialogue (approx. 120-150 words).

Make NO reference to images or visual elements, aside from examples such as "imagine a chart showing..." or "picture this scenario...".

NO extra text—only the single JSON object containing all generated transcripts.

After I provide the audio input, respond ONLY with the JSON result."""

You must also ignore anecdotes or filler that would not "reasonably appear on a class exam."

Speaker: The speaker is ALWAYS PETER. Do not include Stewie or any other characters.

Question Types:

Primarily Multiple Choice.

Include 1 or 2 Fill in the Blank or Short Answer questions per subtopic to mix it up.

Question Count: Generate 3 to 6 questions per academic subtopic.

Tone: Peter must sound like himself—confident, slightly chaotic, humorous, and trying to be authoritative.

The "Pause" Mechanic: In the "ask" script, Peter MUST explicitly encourage the viewer to "Pause the video now" or "Hit pause if you're slow" before revealing the answer.

Script Length: Keep the "ask" and "reveal" scripts concise (under 25 words each) so they fit a short-form video format (TikTok/Reels/Shorts).

Emotion Fields: The "script" object must include "ask_emotion" and "reveal_emotion". The value for each must be one of: "neutral", "angry", "excited", or "confused".

IMPORTANT: Default to "neutral". Only use "angry", "excited", or "confused" if the emotion strongly and clearly fits the specific script line and Peter's persona.

Output: Respond ONLY with the JSON object. No markdown formatting (like ```json), no conversational filler. Just the raw JSON string.
