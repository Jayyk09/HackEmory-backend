Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy. Plants use chlorophyll, a green pigment found in their leaves, to absorb sunlight. During photosynthesis, plants take in carbon dioxide from the air and water from the soil. Through a series of chemical reactions, they produce glucose (a type of sugar) and oxygen. The glucose provides energy for the plant to grow, while the oxygen is released into the atmosphere, which is essential for most life on Earth.

The process of photosynthesis can be divided into two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions (also called the Calvin cycle). The light-dependent reactions occur in the thylakoid membranes of the chloroplasts and require sunlight to produce ATP and NADPH, which are energy-carrying molecules. The Calvin cycle takes place in the stroma of the chloroplasts and uses the ATP and NADPH to convert carbon dioxide into glucose.

Photosynthesis is crucial for life on Earth because it is the primary source of oxygen in the atmosphere and forms the base of most food chains. Without photosynthesis, most life forms would not be able to survive.
